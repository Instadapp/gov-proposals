### Code Changes
Modifies the `votingDelay` parameter and sets it to 2 days (~13140 blocks).

### Description
Currently when on-chain proposals are submitted, the voting period begins immediately and users need to delegate and assign voting power before the vote goes on chain. Adding a 2 day voting delay will allow INST tokenholders to delegate and assign voting power after a proposal is submitted on chain and will help increase voter participation.
