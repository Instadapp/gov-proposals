### Code Changes
- Modifies the ‘votingDelay’ parameter and sets it to 2 days (~13140 blocks).
- Modifies the ‘votingPeriod’ from 2.63 days (~17280 blocks) to 3 days (~19710 blocks).


### Description
Currently when on-chain proposals are submitted, the voting period begins immediately and users need to delegate and assign voting power before the vote goes on chain. Adding a 2 day voting delay will allow INST tokenholders to delegate and assign voting power after a proposal is submitted on chain and will help increase voter participation. The Voting Period is currently set to slightly above 2.5 days, this will modify the voting period to 3 days.
