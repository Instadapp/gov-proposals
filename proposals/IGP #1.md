# Governance Acceptance of Admin Rights

- Replace the 10-day Multisig timelock with the Governance timelock
- Replace the "chief" role from the team Multisig to Governance.

### Description

Currently, the governance of the protocol contracts is held by a [10-day timelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc7cb1de2721bfc0e0da1b9d526bcdc54ef1c0efc); this proposal will replace that with the governance timelock contract. The Chief role, responsible for adding and removing connectors, is held by the [team’s MultiSig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1DC62EC38E6E3857a887210C38418E4A17Da5B2).

It will replace the team’s MultiSig admin with Governance. All future changes to connectors will be managed by Governance. This proposal will finalize the distribution of the underlying admin rights held by the team to the community.
